# Setting up a development environment

The first thing to do is clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/jsonnull/aleamancer.git
cd aleamancer
```

We use yarn to manage dependencies. Run it to get all dependencies needed to
build and test the project:

```
yarn
```

The `package.json` contains entries in `scripts` for building, testing,
linting, and type-checking. These four steps are run on CI as wellâ€”all pull
requests must pass CI before being merged, so keep these in mind during
development.

# Development workflow

The webpack build server is started using `npm run start`. Unfortunately,
hot-module-reloading is broken in recent versions of `react-redux`, so manual
refreshes may be required.

To view your local changes, simply open a local server that serves static
assets from the `public/` dir. One easy way to do this is with the
`http-server` command-line tool:

```shell
yarn global add http-server # or npm install -g http-server
http-server -c-1 # will automatically serve public, and disables caching
```
